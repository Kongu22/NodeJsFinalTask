# Task Management System

## Introduction

This project marks my initial venture into the realm of backend development, concentrating on the deployment of a Node.js-based application. At its essence, the application is devised as a comprehensive task management system. It is engineered to support the creation, monitoring, and structuration of a variety of tasks, thereby serving as a practical tool for enhancing productivity and organizational efficiency.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to delve into and master the fundamental aspects and components of Node.js, setting a solid foundation for the development of more intricate backend systems. Through this endeavor, I aim to showcase a proficient grasp of crucial server-side development principles, including but not limited to RESTful API architecture and efficient data management strategies essential for the development of contemporary web applications.

## Features

- **Task Creation:** Users can easily add new tasks, specifying details such as title, description, and deadlines.
- **Task Tracking:** The system provides functionalities to view all tasks, along with their current status (pending, in progress, completed).
- **Task Organization:** Tasks can be categorized and filtered based on various criteria, facilitating efficient task management.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js:** A runtime environment for executing JavaScript code server-side, forming the backbone of our application.
- **Express.js:** A web application framework for Node.js, used to simplify the development of web applications and RESTful APIs.
- **MongoDB:** A NoSQL database, chosen for its flexibility and scalability, which stores and manages the application's data.
